This is a standard Java program, to run the program, you can copy & paste the source code to a Java running environment such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. You can create a new project and put this java file into ‘src’ folder. Then you should put the test image into the project directory. (My default way is to create a folder called ‘image’ under the project directory and put test images in it. Don’t forget to rename the image if necessary, the file name should correspond to the input source in the code). The generated images will be stored in the same folder with a filename - ‘output’.
